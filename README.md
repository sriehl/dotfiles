# Steven Riehl's dot files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.

Vim-users will likely find useful stuff in my [vimrc](vimrc), and also my [Ruby snippets](vim/snippets/ruby.snippets).

I'm also a pretty aggressive aliaser. You might find a few you like in [zsh/aliases](zsh/aliases).

## Installation

  `git clone git://github.com/sriehl/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
  `cd ~/.dotfiles`
  `rake install`

  Vim plugins are managed through vundle. You'll need to install vundle to get them.

  `git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`
  Run `:BundleInstall` in vim.
